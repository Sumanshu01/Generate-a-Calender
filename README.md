# Calendar Viewer
This repository contains two implementations of a simple calendar viewer: one in C (calendar.c) and another in Python (calendar.py). Both programs allow users to input a specific year and month, and then display the corresponding calendar for that month.

## Features:
### C Implementation:
- Uses Zeller's Congruence algorithm to calculate the first day of the month.
- Determines the number of days in a month considering leap years.
- Displays the calendar in a tabular format starting with Sunday.
- Offers an interactive option to view multiple months without restarting the program.

### Python Implementation:
- Utilizes the built-in calendar module for generating the calendar.
- Displays the calendar with weekdays starting from Monday.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to navigate between months or exit the program.
- These programs are great examples of working with dates and implementing calendar-based functionalities in different programming languages. Whether youâ€™re a beginner exploring algorithms or simply learning how to use standard libraries effectively, this repository provides an insightful comparison of approaches.
